  IMDb's web site redesign
  ========================

On 19 February 2007, IMDb introduced a complete redesign of their
web site.

Since release 3.0, IMDbPY uses a new account to access the IMDb
web site, parsing the new layout.

Older version still access the old layout, so they are still (more
or less) working; obviously only the new layout is supported by
now on.
