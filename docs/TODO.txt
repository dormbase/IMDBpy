  TODO for IMDbPY
  ===============

See the code, and search for XXX, FIXME and TODO.

NOTE: it's time to clean the code!


[general]
* Unify Movie and Person classes? (UserDict or dict subclasses?)
* Write better summary() methods for Movie and Person classes.


[searches]
* Support advanced query for movie titles/person names.


[Movie objects]
* Define invariable names for the sections (the keys you use to access
  info stored in a Movie object).
* Gather more data; information left out: user comments, external/newsgroup
  reviews, reccomendations, amazon.com summaries, merchandising links,
  laserdisc details, trailers, posters, photo gallery, on tv, schedule links,
  showtimes, miscellaneous, photographs, sound clips, video clips,
  message boards.
* Should the __contains__() methods descend lists and dictionaries?


[Person objects]
* Define invariable names for the sections (the keys you use to access
  info stored in a Person object).
* Gather more data; left out data: publicity, agent (local only),
  photo gallery, news articles.


[http data access system]
* If the access through the proxy fails, try without proxy.
* Access to the "my IMDb" functions for registered users would
  be really cool.


[local data access system]
* Improve performances, especially for searching names/titles.
* The convBin() and getFullIndex() functions in the utils
  modules _must_ be rewritten (they're crap!).
* Some files are not considered: mpaa-ratings-reasons.list,
  business.list.gz, literature.list, miscellaneous-companies.list,
  mpaa-ratings-reasons.list.
* I'm not sure that the ratober.search_title() function works
  correctly with movies with a '(' in the title.
* You need the mkdb executable from the moviedb program to generate the
  database/index files; moviedb is not open source software (although
  it can be downloaded and used without paying money).
  An open source (pure python?) script must be written.
  NOTE: this MUST be done.
  Files like biographies.data are plainly wrong: sometimes
  a person is referred with 'Name Surname' (qv) and sometimes
  with 'Surname, Name' (qv).
  Names and titles with "'" are not handled properly and so on...
