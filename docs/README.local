  LOCAL INSTALLATION
  ==================

NOTE: since you've to download the whole IMDb database,
consider using the 'sql' data access system (it's faster
and generally better than the 'local' one).  See the README.sqldb
file.
Obviously you can still prefer to use the 'local' data access
system if you're already using the moviedb program.


Select a mirror of the "The Plain Text Data Files" from
the http://www.imdb.com/interfaces.html page and download
every file in the main directory (beware that the "diffs"
subdirectory contains _a lot_ of files you _don't_ need,
so don't start mirroring everything!).

From the same page, download also the latest version (3.24, as
I'm writing) of the Col Needham's command line programs (moviedb),
under the tools directory.

Install moviedb; in a stage of the installation, the mkdb program will
generate a lot of data and index files in the directory specified by
the DBDIR variable in the Makefile.

Now you can use IMDbPY on these data:
  from imdb import IMDb
  i = IMDb('local', '/the/DBDIR/directory/')
  resList = i.search_movie('the incredibles')
  for x in resList: print x
  ti = resList[1]
  i.update(ti)
  print ti['director'][0]

and so on...
