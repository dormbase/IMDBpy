  LOCAL INSTALLATION
  ==================

NOTE: since you've to download the whole IMDb database,
consider the use of the 'sql' data access system (it's faster
and generally better than the 'local' one).  See the README.sqldb
file.
Obviously you can still prefer to use the 'local' data access
system if you're already using the moviedb program.


Select a mirror of the "The Plain Text Data Files" from
the http://www.imdb.com/interfaces.html page and download
every file in the main directory (beware that the "diffs"
subdirectory contains _a lot_ of files you _don't_ need,
so don't start mirroring everything!).

From the same page, download also the latest version (3.24, as
I'm writing) of the Col Needham's command line programs (moviedb),
under the tools directory.

NOTE: the current (3.24) moviedb version is old an it was not
thought with tv series episodes support in mind.
It can still work very well, but you've to modify some constants
in the code: edit the "moviedb.h" file in the "src" directory,
and change MAXTITLES to _at least_ 1400000, MAXNAKAENTRIES
to 700000 and LINKSTART to 1000000.
See http://us.imdb.com/database_statistics for more up-to-date
statistics.

Install moviedb; in a stage of the installation, the mkdb program will
generate a lot of data and index files in the directory specified by
the DBDIR variable in the Makefile.

Now you can use IMDbPY on these data:
  from imdb import IMDb
  i = IMDb('local', '/the/DBDIR/directory/')
  resList = i.search_movie('the incredibles')
  for x in resList: print x
  ti = resList[1]
  i.update(ti)
  print ti['director'][0]

and so on...
