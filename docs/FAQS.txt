  IMDbPY FAQS
  ===========

Q1: Since version 3.7, parsing the data from the IMDb web site is slow,
    sloow, slooow!  Why?

A1: if python-lxml is not installed in your system, IMDbPY uses the
    pure-python BeautifulSoup module as a fall-back; BeautifulSoup does
    an impressive job, but it can't be as fast as a parser written in C.
    You can install python-lxml following the instructions in the
    README.newparsers file.
