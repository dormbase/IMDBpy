I'd like to thank the following people for their help:

* Tero Saarni, for the series 60 GUI and a lot of testing and
  debugging.

* Nick S. Novikov, who provided the Windows installer until I've
  managed to set up a Windows development environment.

* Simone Bacciglieri, who downloaded the plain text data files for me.

* Carmine Noviello, for some design hints.

* "Basilius" for a bug report.
